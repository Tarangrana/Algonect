  <h1>Community Guidelines</h1>
  <p>
    Iscicle is a place for international students and allies to collaborate, converse, and learn from one another.
    In order to ensure that this is a safe space, please follow the following guidelines:
  </p>

  <h5>Bring your best self</h5>
  <p>
    Bring your best self to Iscicle, and expect others to bring their best selves too!
    Iscicle is a welcoming and collaborative space for you to learn, share, and grow.
    Please do not engage in behavior that is inappropriate or harmful, and expect that others will follow these rules as well.
    If you believe someone is in violation of our guidelines, please let us know at <a href="mailto:support@iscicle.com" class="email-link">support@iscicle.com</a>, or report them via the mobile app.
  </p>

  <h5>What can I post about?</h5>
  <p>
    Anything related to your experience as an international student! Share questions, opportunities, resources, events,
    personal experiences, advice, and more. This is a safe space where you can be vulnerable and candid — but we still moderate all posts, so keep it respectful.
  </p>

  <h5>What can't I post about?</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>No spam, advertisements, or solicitations of any kind.</li>
    <li>No posting the same content in multiple spaces — pick the most relevant one.</li>
    <li>No harmful content — this includes promotion of violence, hate speech, misinformation, exploitation of minors, self-harm, drugs, illicit activity, trolling, or bullying.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>What are spaces?</h5>
  <p>Spaces are categories for organizing and discovering posts. Here’s a quick overview:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Advice</strong>: Tips, lessons, or wisdom based on your experiences.</li>
    <li><strong>Meme</strong>: International student struggles? Let it out with humor.</li>
    <li><strong>Rant</strong>: Vent your frustrations. We’re listening.</li>
    <li><strong>Storytime</strong>: Share memorable, fun, or insightful moments.</li>
    <li><strong>Question</strong>: Ask anything — if it ends with a “?”, it belongs here.</li>
    <li><strong>Wins</strong>: Landed an internship? Made a home-cooked meal? Let’s celebrate with you!</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Still have questions?</h5>

    Reach out to our team anytime at <a href="mailto:support@iscicle.com" class="email-link">support@iscicle.com</a>.

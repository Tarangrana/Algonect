  <h1>Community Guidelines</h1>
  <p>
    AlgoNect is a space for Algoma University students to connect, share, and grow together. In order to maintain a positive and respectful environment, please follow the guidelines below.
  </p>

  <h5>Be respectful and authentic</h5>
  <p>
    AlgoNect is your university’s digital community lounge. Treat it like one. Share openly, support others, and keep the tone kind and inclusive.
    Avoid any behavior that could make others feel unsafe or unwelcome.
    If you witness something inappropriate, please let us know at <a href="mailto:support@algonect.com" class="email-link">support@algonect.com</a>.
  </p>

  <h5>What can I post?</h5>
  <p>
    Anything related to your life as a university student! This includes course discussions, advice, daily experiences, questions, rants, fun stories, or helpful resources.
    All content should align with AlgoNect's mission to foster a supportive academic and social environment.
  </p>

  <h5>What shouldn’t I post?</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>No spam, ads, or promotional content.</li>
    <li>Don't post the same content across multiple tags (spaces) — choose the one that fits best.</li>
    <li>No content that promotes hate, discrimination, violence, misinformation, bullying, or any form of illegal or harmful activity.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>What are spaces?</h5>
  <p>Spaces are categories that help organize posts. Current AlgoNect spaces include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>General</strong>: Anything that doesn’t fit a specific category.</li>
    <li><strong>Advice</strong>: Academic tips, mental health help, campus tips, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Rant</strong>: Got something to get off your chest? This is the place.</li>
    <li><strong>Storytime</strong>: Fun, emotional, or random stories from campus life.</li>
    <li><strong>Question</strong>: Anything you’re wondering about — classes, events, or life.</li>
  </ul>
